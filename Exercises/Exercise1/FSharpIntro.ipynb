    "## What is F# ?\n",
    "\n",
    "[F#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/what-is-fsharp) is a [statically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking), [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) programming language that is part of the [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language) ) family.\n",
    "Originally intended to be an implementation of [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) (another ML family language) on [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) (the virtual machine used by Microsoft for its home-grown programming languages, such as [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) ) and [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_.NET)), F# has eventually evolved to become a separate, full blown programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of F# for software development are manifold:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Thanks to its strong, static type system, programs written in F# are guaranteed to be free from a wide range of errors otherwise common in dynamic languages such as Python or Ruby.\n",
    "It is a good example of the famous principle of [type safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety) described by Robin Milner in 1978, stating that \"well typed programs do not go wrong\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* Altough F# is statically typed, programmers only very rarely need to write down type annotations in the language, thanks to the powerful [Hindley-Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system) type inference algorithm used by its compiler.\n",
    "This can often give programmers the illusion of writing in a dynamic language, while retaining static type safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Being a functional programming language, F# encourages a declarative style of programming based on the composition of functions applied on immutable objects, with minimal use of side effects. This makes reasoning about programs easier than in imperative languages, which include a mutable state that can change at any moment and implicitly influence computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Although F# is designed to be *functional-first*, other approaches like the [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) paradigm are also supported by the language. In fact, F# is fully interoperable with C#, an object-oriented programming language widely used in the industry. This means that the rich ecosystem of libraries available for C# is also usable from F#.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Being an ML family member, F# is equipped with [algebraic data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type) and [pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching), two powerful abstraction mechanisms that make it very expressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to all of the elements cited above, we will see that F# is also a good fit to implement the notions that will be addressed in the *formal methods* course.\n",
    "The high-level of abstraction of the language will allow us to easily express mathematical concepts and make the translation from theory to practice relatively straightforward. "

    "#### Primitive Types:\n",

    "A number of primitive types are defined in F#:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Integers**: they are expressed with literals in decimal form, such as `42` or `1337`. The usual operators are defined on them (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.). Their type is `int`. An example of an expression that evaluates to an integer value is `42 * 2 - 12`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Floats**: floating point numbers are expressed as numbers with a decimal part, such as `0.5` or `1.3333333`. Again, the usual operators are defined on them. Their type is `float`. An example of an expression that evaluates to a `float` is `1.5 * 3.5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Booleans**: the set of boolean values is `true` and `false`. Their type is denoted `bool`. The usual operations are defined on them: `||`, `&&`, `not`, etc. Comparison expressions (like `3 < 4`, for example) evaluate to boolean values. An example of an expression that evaluates to a `bool` is `3 < 10 = true || false`. Here, `=` is the equality operator, which would be written `==` in an imperative language like C.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Strings**: string literals are written between quotes, as we saw in the *hello world* example. Their type is `string`. In F#, it is possible to embed expressions inside of strings, which are then replaced by their result at runtime. Those special strings (called **interpolated strings**) are prepended with a `$` sign and expressions to be evaluated inside of them are placed between brackets. For example, the string `$\"{3 * 3}\"` evaluates to `\"9\"` at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unit**: in functional languages, the special `unit` type is used to denote the absence of a meaningful value in a computation. It is more or less equivalent to `void` in C, or `None` in Python. `unit` is used to give a type to expressions that perform some action like printing a string in the console and whose return value is unimportant. The only value that has type `unit` in F# is `()`, the empty tuple. "

    "Therefore, if there is a type error in an expression, it will be discovered during compilation, before even trying to run the application.\n",
    "This is a very powerful mechanism, because it can prevent many kinds errors from ever happening, like adding a boolean with an integer, for example.\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition to the primitive types presented earlier, *composite* types are also available in F#:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tuples**: tuples can be used to group values of different types together. They are particularly useful when a function must return multiple values or in pattern matching. Elements in a tuple are separated by commas (`,`) and put between parentheses. For example, a tuple composed of a boolean, an integer and a string can be written `(true, 42, \"life\")`. The type of a tuple is written by listing the types of its elements, separated by `*` . The type of the tuple given as example is `bool * int * string`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lists**: lists can be used to group an arbitrary number of values of the same type together. They are an example of one of the numerous collections commonly used in functional programming. A list literal is written between square brackets (`[` and `]`), with the values inside it separated by semicolons (`;`). For example, `[1; 2; 3]` is a list of integers. The empty list is `[]`. All of the values in a list must be of the same type. A value can be appended at the beginning of a list with the operator `::`, as in `1 :: 2 :: 3 :: []`, which is equivalent to `[1; 2; 3]`. As we have seen, in functional languages, values are immutable. This means that when we append a value to a list, a new list is returned by the operation, without mutating the original.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, lists are polymorphic, because the same type structure can be used to contain values of type `int`, `bool` or any other type.\n",
    "The type of lists is written `list<'A>` to indicate that lists are parametrised by some type parameter `'A` (type parameters are always written starting with a `'` and between `<` and `>`, after a polymorphic type's name).\n",
    "When an actual list is built for some concrete type, the parameter `'A` is replaced by it in the type signature. \n",
    "For example, lists of integers have type `list<int>`, whereas lists of booleans have type `list<bool>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types can actually be parametrised by an arbitrary number of other types. For example, `Map`s (similar to dictionaries in other languages, as we will see later) have two type parameters denoting the types of their keys and values. `Map<string, int>` is a map that associates `string`s to `int`s, whereas `Map<bool, string>` is a mapping from `bool`s to `string`s."
